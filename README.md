## Welcome to the KuriRobot Documentation Repository

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/KuriRobot/documentation/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview 
the content for your website in Markdown files, or edit Markdown files in 
your favorite editor.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Special Mayfield Markdown

In the future, we will support cross-linking in documentation, along with 
search. To link to other documenation, simply surround 
the name of the target with double back ticks:
```
``audio_voice_delegate`` or ``Awake.msg``
```

Targets are generally titles specified in front matter in reference 
documentation, or headers (`# Header`, `## Header`, `### Header`, etc) in 
guides.
